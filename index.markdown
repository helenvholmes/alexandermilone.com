## Transit advocacy, Philadelphia

I’m a transit advocate and board member at [5th Square](https://www.5thsqadvocacy.org/), where I work to advance safe, affordable, and accessible transportation for Philadelphians. My focus is improving the reliability, equity, and everyday experience of public transit across the city. I believe that strong transit systems help people live healthier, happier lives and connect communities to opportunity. I write op-eds and frequently speak with journalists about transit policy, street safety, and the choices that shape how we move through our city. My goal is to support a more connected, people-focused Philadelphia built around high-quality service and streets that work for everyone.
